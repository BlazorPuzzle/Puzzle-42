### The Challenge:

This is a .NET 8 Blazor Web App with Global Server Interactivity.

We have a `<div>` with a scrollbar to show more items than fit on a page.

We want to be able to keep the size of the `<div>` consistent when the browser is resized.

We have set the height to 80% of the view height (`height:80vh;`), but it doesn't quite work.

How can we make  this work?
